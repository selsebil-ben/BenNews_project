## Project notes :
- This  is a front-end mini-project built with Next.js & Bootstrap
- The project is fed by a NewsAPI.
- Please note that the NewsAPI is free that's why u can not call it more than 10 times. The API call is made through a Use effect hook each time you change either the category or the language.
- Install all the packages with the cmd >npm install
